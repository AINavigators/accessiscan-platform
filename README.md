# AccessiScan AI Platform

## Overview

AccessiScan AI is an accessibility auditing platform developed to support infrastructure inspectors, compliance officers, and researchers in assessing accessibility compliance against the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport (DSAPT).

The platform combines a FastAPI backend, SQLite database, and a custom-trained YOLOv8-Pose computer vision model to automate the detection and evaluation of accessibility infrastructure components such as ramps, stairs, tactile indicators, handrails, platform gaps, and accessibility signage.

The system processes uploaded inspection images, performs AI-powered accessibility analysis, generates compliance findings, and stores inspection records for future review and auditing.

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AccessiScan_AI_Platform
```

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages from the project root:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running the Platform

From the project root directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Alternatively:

```bash
python main.py
```

A successful startup should display messages similar to:

```text
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Application startup complete
```

---

# Swagger API Interface

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

The Swagger interface provides:

* Endpoint testing
* Request validation
* Response inspection
* API documentation

---

# Running an Accessibility Audit

1. Open the Swagger interface.
2. Expand:

```text
POST /api/v1/inspections/process-asset
```

3. Select **Try it out**.
4. Upload an inspection image.
5. Execute the request.

The platform will:

* Validate the uploaded image.
* Execute YOLOv8-Pose inference.
* Detect accessibility features.
* Evaluate compliance criteria.
* Store inspection data in SQLite.
* Generate audit findings and evidence imagery.

---

# Database

AccessiScan utilizes:

```text
SQLite + SQLModel
```

Database tables are automatically generated during application startup.

Core entities include:

* User
* Inspection
* Detection
* Report
* Image

The database file is stored locally as:

```text
accessiscan_backend/app.db
```

---

# Testing

Execute the automated test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

The testing framework validates:

* API endpoints
* Database functionality
* Inspection workflows
* Persistence operations
